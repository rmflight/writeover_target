<p>The human: Man, and its overrepresentation.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>”</p>
<p>Sylvia Wynter</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://rmflight.github.io/symbiosisnovel/chapters/chapter-3/">Previous Chapter</a></p>
<p>You have discovered inhabitable planets, at least, those inhabitable by your standards. You have wondered how long it will take to travel there. You have questioned why alien species who might live there have not reached out to you; made contact.</p>
<p>I assure you, we know who you are. But you were not interesting to the rest of the universe. Not until we arrived on your planet to judge your corporeal potential.</p>
<p>My Ks’ou name and tree were never important to me. I was known as Commander, and I would become <em>Ke’Ad</em>, the highest rankings for a Ks’ou. My tactics were precise and effective. My praxis, bent towards the Ks’ou Nation. No one could question my dedication, and that is why I survived as long as I did. If you must know, I was born Kelisfton, Salix Adrath Kinë, <em>kyôsta-fs</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Yet as I said, that is not important.</p>
<p>I was one of the last born on the homeworld before births were relegated to ships in preparation for world conquests. This offered me a compromised and composed position that was unique: the homeworld was mine, though it was not quite home for Ks’ou. I remembered it. And because I did, I later imagined what life might have been had we been able to establish a true culture, as Humans, Thhiyatkhoor, and so many others did.</p>
<p>But this was not to be our case.</p>
<p>Instead, we were shuffled off into a war we had only begun to understand, started by others that we barely knew who came before us, and were sent to die for a cause that was not fully clear to us. All this was rather disorganized, I&rsquo;ll admit.</p>
<p>“War is the great equalizer,” was a phrase I would learn from a species I had not yet fully met. If I had heard the phrase at the time, I would not have understood. Equalizer of what? Ks&rsquo;ou are deaf to outer-water creatures, though we easily hear one another. We are considered blind, but have our own way of seeing.</p>
<p>Ks&rsquo;ou are brilliant.</p>
<p>Among ourselves, we were already equal, the only difference were those with ambition, as was I, and those without. We all had the same colonizing instinct.</p>
<p>Colonization was a great equalizer; <em>Settling</em>, a greater one. While some species wasted time colonizing one another to take ownership of resources, materials, land, and the like, Ks’ou had the greatest form of colonization of all. We were empowered with the ability to crawl into other creatures, extend ourselves into their furthest corners, and take over their bodies. We could harness their language, and, if skilled enough, colonize that creature mentally.</p>
<p>Ours was a complete and holistic colonization.</p>
<p><em>Then</em>, war. Against other creatures, war was necessary to make us even. To put us on the plane so that other species would contend with us. We were born weak in body but mighty in spirit and intellect. We knew how to climb the ladder of master species, learning how to be adept through them, and subduing them when necessary. Our efforts would be in the name of making us present to the universe.</p>
<p>Let our being be known.</p>
<p>“Move in closer,” I ordered the lowly soldier manning the ship. This new planet, one I had recently discovered via the Thhiyatkhoor—our wretched enemy—was a risk, as it was likely that there would be Thhiyatkhoor on this planet as well, but one does not become Ke’Ad Designated anything by restraining from risks.</p>
<p>I’d settled the body of a <em>Besh</em>, a large, four-torsoed creature with broad shoulders, a jaw that clenched, and skin like interwoven shards of glass. The formidable giant was as easy to control as it was to ignore. Its pleadings for me to release it had long since been set aside to simple whimpers and minute speculations about its future. They were simple, unsophistocated creatures, and it was unfortunate that so many had been slaughtered in war, as they made wonderful, powerful warriors.</p>
<p>Not as good as the <em>Olyat-Koi</em>, however. The <em>Besh</em> bodies were strong, but minds weak. The <em>Olyat-Koi</em> excelled where the <em>Besh—and humans</em>—failed. For the <em>Olyat-Koi</em>, their flesh and spirit both intertwined in a dizzying display of ontological excellence, full of vast knowledge, and skilled in movement and grace. I would Settle one at all costs.</p>
