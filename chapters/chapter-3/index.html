<p>Not all heroes die in a fantastic blaze of light.</p>
<p>Some die quite normally, with facility. Closed eyes and a simple, unperturbed decision to shift, to decay into the next mode of being.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the middle of the night, from a lung that refuses to fill, or a heart that refuses to beat, organs consumed by the slow burn of existence.</p>
<p>Some die in the dark, alone. The hunter become the hunted.</p>
<p>As you know, when my father eventually died, he did not get to choose the manner of death. He was in fact not far from my position on Earth, and his proximity would haunt me for a long time to come. He did not die in a glorious battle; it was a small skirmish compared to a lifetime of excellent engagement in war. He would die, I had first imagined, by the hands of the creatures whom he had committed his life to destroying. A lucky shot from a large Ks’ou ship refusing to follow Thhiyatkhoor protocol. They returned fire before their own ship exploded, enemy eliminating enemy at once.</p>
<p>There was no great battle to be won. No hero story to tell. Not even an individual that I could use to avenge my father’s death.</p>
<p>Before the incident, my last words to my father were, “I disown you.”</p>
<p>And his to me, “It is a good thing, young Efyir, that our people do not allow sons to disown their fathers. But you will refer to me as General in lieu of father until you have regained sense.”</p>
<p>He ended transmission at that moment. The final exchange between father and son in our interminable battle for mutual respect.</p>
<p>In re-encountering his final transmission, I realized that I misjudged a great many things about him.</p>
<p>My only hope was that, before his death, he realized that he had misjudged me. That he lived in a different time than I did, and was indeed, against me in chronotopic resonance. His ally in the first war, the Human Kahti, the remainder of their particular era, seemed to think so.</p>
<p>I was temporarily expatriated to Earth as a punishment for disobedience. I was to learn from my father’s friend, Kahti, and her daughter—my sister-without-crown—about Human ways. My father found his time on Earth, just as his <em>ekhair</em> after whom I was named, necessary to his formation as Thhiyatkhoor. His philosophy was that one could not understand their own people until they began to understand another’s.</p>
<p>It took me many years to realize that his philosophy and my own were ultimately, at their ends, the same.</p>
<p>However, my father’s mistake, which I, eventually, would not to repeat, was this:</p>
<p>He refused to learn from our enemy, the Ks’ou.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>“|If you think history flatters you,||” General Shyridin was saying, “||Then you are impaled on your history like a butterfly on a pin.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> You are incapable of seeing or changing yourself or the world. These words come from the Human James Baldwin in Earth Year they call 1965 Anno Domini, for them; these words which resonate with many species today. Do we find ourselves, us Thhiyatkhoor, impaled? Do we find us feeding ourselves the lies of inhumility? Or are we committed to dismantling ourselves from the bias of our speciesisms? In other words, how do we carry our history <em>within</em> us?||”</p>
<p>Efyir-Azayim sank lower in his chair as the General spoke.</p>
<p>“||Qwa, what is a <em>butterfly</em>||?” someone whispered loudly behind him.</p>
<p>“||An Earth insect with four, easily breakable wings. Don’t you pay attention in our <em>Anthropology of Carbon-Based Earthen Lifeforms</em> class?||” another hissed.</p>
<p>“||No. What does an Earth-bound <em>butterfly</em> have to do with <em>us</em>?||”</p>
<p>The class had been filled with an eager energy at first, but the more words were said, the more unfamiliar it seemed to the rest, who were sure to find these so very <em>Human</em>, so very un-Thhiyatkhoor-like. Some of their kind had begun to smirk, shown as diffused cloudbursts on their slate. Others began to whisper, both great- and few-branched individuals, glancing from Efyir back to the General, and passing along words with unkind eyes.</p>
<p>General Shyridin had a commanding physical presence. His head-<em>naghryoja</em>, well-curated, twisted and circular, sported twenty offshoots, unheard of for most Thhiyatkhoor; he was tall, and the scar he sported across his face, a near-fatal attack, was a testimony to his many years in war. It was odd for him to be appearing alone; but then again, not entirely out of place, for who he was as General.</p>
<p>His advisors had counseled him to stand without speaking, that by merely looking he could communicate more than were he were to open his mouth, but this was something he refused to do. He had much to say, and felt the drag of time that might keep him from saying it. So it was that the General continued speaking, boldly, as though not noticing the diminishing return of energy in each room he spoke in such as this one.</p>
<p>“||The Thhiyatkhoor have led excellent legacies, and won many wars. Yet we suffer from an arrogance which keeps us content, as though our political status in the universe, and ability to win wars, will continue indefinitely. I warn you—our approaches must change, we must consider the mediation of other successful species such as Humans, if we are to continue thriving.||”</p>
<p>There were embarrassed glances shot in Efyir’s direction, though no one, not even his closest <em>ekhair</em>, or non-blood-brother, would say a word to him or look at him in his black eyes directly. What Thhiyatkhoor invokes the means and manners of other species in order to conduct their work? The General, it was now agreed, had spent far too much time on Earth, away from his true species, to speak to his own people.</p>
<p>Per Thhiyatkhoor custom, no one would dare challenge the General with direct insult. But it could be done with subtlety, which the lagoon-toiler Taghyr was known for. When it came time for questions, he was the first in line. Efyir longed for the time when those people were not allowed at such events. But tides were changing, and to combat the universe’s diminishing opinion of Thhiyatkhoor, it was seen as a great gesture of inclusion to allow lagoon-toilers and war-born to discuss politics together, even if the toilers rarely had anything valuable to add to the discussion.</p>
<p>“||You maintain the Ks’ou are no longer a threat||,” Taghyr said. His crown was gangly, twisting in odd directions because it had not been well shaped. It was hard for Efyir to take him seriously, but others seemed to do so, which forced him to pay attention to this <em>toiler</em> with so few articulate words. “||Yet wasn’t it the final decision on Earth that keeps their species thriving to this day||?”</p>
<p>“||The Great Alliance decided collectively on this course of action,||” General Shyridin said, though it sounded rather meek at this point. “||Thhiyatkhouw, I assure you, I elected against it. There would have been nothing greater than to rid ourselves, finally, of the enduring infamy of the Ks’ou ignominy, and I remind you that it has been my life’s work to undo the damage of this Human-based decision.||”</p>
<p>“||What kind of Thiyatkhoor listens to the whims of Humans?||” Taghyr muttered. He had stepped back to say it away from the amplifier, so that the General would not hear his words but those in close proximity of the audience did, and it rippled in whispers throughout the rest of the crowd with a shockingly quick pace.</p>
<p>The General was of a dying era; older, but not considered wiser, his words were watered to soundbites of a mumbling ancient, relevant to only the forgotten, the near-buried, and the dead.</p>
<p>The session ended, they filed out, and each of what he once considered his own seemed to quicken or slow their pace aside Efyir. He stood outside the ceremony building wishing he had never gone, wishing against his own bloodline. Taghyr, in his grey-edged, light tan tunic, approached Efyir with several of his colleagues.</p>
<p>It was always Taghyr who seemed to speak; at least from what Efyir could remember. “||Ah, the Earth-born! Is that not true?||”</p>
<p>Efyir grit his teeth. Taghyr and he were close in history; they both had head-<em>naghryoja</em> with only two shoots from their branches. Because of this, they followed many of the same classes, though Taghyr could not attend the warrior sessions once their shared classes ended. Their destinies were different, but because they were parallel, Efyir had no choice but to speak:</p>
<p>“||It is no secret. My parents returned before I was of remembering age. And it was still a proper birth, in the woods.||”</p>
<p>“||Then perhaps you are wiser than your father, the Human-lover,||” Taghyr sneered. His entourage, none of them warriors, offered unkind sounds of encouragement.</p>
<p>“||His thesis is sound, even if it seems out of place,||” Efyir attempted.</p>
<p>“||Your elder father has reached the end of his prime. Sure, he fought his wars, and well, it seems. But simply fighting a war does not give one permission to speak. Perhaps he should let the present Thhiyatkhoor frame the current world for him. After all, his moment is over.||”</p>
<p>Efyir tried to leave; he truly did. But Taghyr was relentless, finding offense when the other turned his shoulder to him.</p>
<p>“||You haven’t the courage to meet a like in battle. Your father is dust, while you, you do not even know what ripening is.||”</p>
<p>Efyir stopped walking. His left arm extended as though automatic. A threat such as Taghyr’s could not go ignored if he could save any shred of his dignity among Thhiyatkhoor. He would not remember his arm blades meeting Taghyr’s face, but everyone present would tell of the satisfying shriek he gave when it happened.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Jacque, pronounced Jack-ee with the Human tongue, was Kahti&rsquo;s daughter. She looked like her mother but her hair, also very short, was completely black. She taught Efyir how to crouch in the hallway in such a way that he could hear the conversation on the OptiScreen without exposing himself. He would never have conceived of such a plan alone; he often defaulted to his own body, but was beginning to realize that stealth was a crucial advantage that Humans <em>sometimes</em> had, simply due to size and shape. As long as they were not in proximity to something that could sense as well as Thhiyatkhoor could, they would be fine.</p>
<p>Efyir’s shell made him appear as human. It was an organo-synthetic material, a <em>living fake</em> as some called it, that he put on and would make him seem human. Like anything organic it needed watering and care, which the PODS provided. He’d chosen this one because it was the same strain as his father’s, the same model cut from his father’s cloth: dark hair, and skin the color of <em>hethalu</em>.</p>
<p>They could have found an off-market shell that would fold them into something slightly smaller, but Kahti was discerning and would notice them attempting to blend in with the wall. She said often ‘She had been around the block’ when it came to folding, though cubes and their relation to knowledge were still a mystery, as many human idioms, to Efyir.</p>
<p>So they sat there listening in, only able to hear Kahti&rsquo;s replies but able to piece together what they could of her conversation with Efyir’s father, who was deliberately transmitting quietly.</p>
<p>“He’s fine,” she was saying. “He’ll be attending school on Monday. I’ve arranged everything; they will only know his <em>zilaa</em> status, nothing else.”</p>
<p>A pause. Then,</p>
<p>“No. Not this year, either. Shyr, you need to come here yourself if you want. Maybe you can help me—<em>damnit</em>, of course I’ve tried. He would recognize your voice and might react differently. He’s your <em>e</em>—.”</p>
<p>She cut off, suddenly. Efyir was thinking about the fact that she called him ‘Shyr’. No one called him that, ever. That Humans reduced names to such a tiny bit of sound was still a mystery to him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know it’s been awhile. But if it’s true that makes you and me the last of us. Doesn’t that matter to you?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Well, he’s safe here. Do you want to talk to him? …Of course.” Kahti sighed rather loudly. “Right, I get it. No Human food. He’s under <em>my</em> care now, stop micro-managing.”</p>
<p>She ended the call abruptly, there was no wishing for success in battle as people often said goodbye to Efyir’s father—whether he was directly headed off to battle or not. The hallway creaked. Aunt Kahti—Efyir was instructed to call her that, because <em>Aunt</em> evoked <em>Auntie</em>—headed away from their position; to this he breathed a sigh of relief. She was grumbling under her breath, “<em>If I want to give him fucking Human food, I will give him fucking Human food.</em>”</p>
<p>When he was sure she had gone to her room, he spoke, “Your mother is very bold. I have never seen anyone speak so directly to my father that way.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Jacque said. She was a dark Human, not as dark as Kahti, but it struck Efyir how many shades Human skin could be. Thhiyatkhoor shades did not vary as widely. “You should see the way she talks to <em>my</em> dad.” As if to change the subject she hurried to add, “You shoulda burst in and demanded to speak to him.”</p>
<p>“No,” Efyir said. “I have nothing to say to him.” The ship had only dropped him off a few days ago, and he still smarted from the reality of being here, stuck, with no way of escaping unless his father granted it.</p>
<p>Jacque regarded him haughtily, crossing her arms. He could tell she was annoyed—she taught him much about how Humans conveyed emotions. But then she seemed to relax. Humans go through many emotions in a very fast amount of time; it was hard to keep up, sometimes. “You seemed a more dangerous <em>prob</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> when we were kids, bro.”</p>
<p>He could tell she was relieved, and he was slightly, too, that he was here. When they were younger, they saw each other perhaps once an Earth year. But that practice stopped, suddenly, when Efyir’s father decided not to return some time ago. While Efyir was not fond of Earth, and often complained of its bizarre practices, he liked Jacque, who had always understood him, beyond his own blood sister.</p>
<p>“I suppose there are worse reasons to be grounded here.” He shifted uncomfortably. His Human shell, the skin-like organic substance, was not the best thing he’d get to wear in his lifetime. In the house, he rarely wore it except when he was near Jacque and participated in her <em>trickery</em>, as she’d called it.</p>
<p>“Ready for school tomorrow, Silverbutt?”</p>
<p>He did not, however, miss this nickname at all. “Don’t call me that. And yes, I am prepared for the Human version of education.”</p>
<p>He did not enroll in any technology courses. Even though Humans knew of and had access to some Thhiyatkhoor technologies, their understanding of them was diminished. Mostly he was to take courses in history, on his father’s demand: “Learn about your past, so that you may understand your present.”</p>
<p>Efyir chose to take Anthropology of Carbon-Based Mammalian Lifeforms; he’d taken it on <em>Routhhe</em>, but the human version fascinated him because Humans continued to be attached to their own version of taxonomy. Though he burned with questions, his father’s adage forced him to be overwhelmingly quiet: “<em>Speak to no one else but those who resonate with your own</em>.”</p>
<p>His father often did not choose to be invisible. Years away from his home planet, from his people, had compelled him to be drawn towards visibility, and therefore to connection, with his people. Efyir’s host-Human on Earth, Aunt Kahti, on the other hand, seemed excessively the contrary to his father. She had withdrawn from Humans, had rebuilt her home in a swath of silence, underscored by nettles, vines, and weeds.</p>
<p>Both of them, heroes of Earth’s first alien colonial conquest vanquished by their past.</p>
<p>In a class arranged not much unlike Thhiyatkhoor lecture halls, he surveyed the room while his mind briefly drifted. He could count 3, maybe 4 <em>zilaa</em> like him. He was sure about the girl seated on the far left.</p>
<p>He’d met her in the woods once before, but decided not to pursue her attempted attack further. She wouldn’t recognize him now that he was in his shell, and he reminded himself as to how his host-aunt and host-sister constantly told him to “ease up”, that he need not invoke the disciplinary stance or military measures of his upbringing.</p>
<p>This <em>zilaa</em> girl seemed by her discourse to both critique and favor humans, and she’d said a few disturbingly even things about the greatest Thhiyatkhoor enemy, the Ks’ou. At this time, many aliens on Earth—except the Ks&rsquo;ou, of course, sanctioned from shell technology and banned from Earth—could choose to take on a shell in place of their own biology and skin, to blend in more with Humans, as they preferred it.</p>
<p>For all their media and stories and imagination, when aliens actually came to Earth Humans proved themselves to be pretty uncomfortable about the whole ordeal, anticipating aliens without fully preparing for their difference. So they invented—Efyir had to admit, <em>cleverly</em>—the shell technology that would protect them from too much difference. The shells were like a human-appearing chamber, within which any alien (even if they were slightly larger than a human) were locked. It wasn’t hard to tell who was not-Human, as they all bore the same insignia, the Z imprinted on their neck. Still, it was difficult to tell who was <em>specifically</em> what. All <em>zilaa</em> could find a POD and eat or regenerate in private as their biology deemed fit, so Efyir could pretend to be any Earth-approved species he wanted to.</p>
<p>When Efyir met her, he appreciated her balance, because she chose to straddle the invisible between, the invisible that was calculated; specific. Her shade of skin shell was as dark as slate as many Thhiyatkhoor, dark like Kahti and Jacque, and her hair, black with small, tight, twisted spirals, was pulled into two spheres on each side of her head with a cascade descending over her neck and back.</p>
<p>She often wore earrings in the shapes of leaves, and always a scarf.</p>
<p>She was scribbling in a book in front of her while the teacher spoke as though distracted, yet, remarkably, each time the teacher asked a question she leapt to answer. Efyir was fascinated but hopelessly lost; his Thhiyatkhoor education lent itself to preparing for the research facility or the battleground, so in the center of the course he turned to her.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>She didn’t notice his words, so he waited to speak again. When she spoke up in class, he rose and responded with what he hoped would inspire a reaction: “Are you a Ks’ou sympathizer?”</p>
<p>This only seemed to anger her; though she noticed the Z-shaped pin grafted to the collar of the skin of his shell, she ignored him for the rest of class.</p>
<p>Her manner of speaking, in addition to the way she’d fought in the woods, marked her as warrior-class. Indeed, she sparred as evenly with her words as she had with her arms.</p>
<p>“I find you decently intolerable,” she would tell him later. This was perhaps progress. He would remember long cords of hair covering her face: bronze, round, discerning. “My name is Aurana.”</p>
