If anyone bothers to ask, we can tell another.”\nThis Ks’ou, who should have been his enemy, said these words as she shifted her weight on the edge of the vault of their damaged ship, then pushed one of the last bottles of water in his direction. It rolled to him easily. He picked it up and tried to suppress the hint of disgust as he drank, but he could not help the display, obvious as a Human grimace. To make this moment worse, the breeze was not so kind as to be cool; still, it was night, and so, between the dust above and the sand below they heaved a collective, if not somewhat forced, sigh of relief from the onslaught that mid-day wrought.\nHe brushed off the feeling of dis-ease: he wasn’t really sharing water with a Ksou.\nShe’ll be dead soon. This didn’t count.\nHer chosen name was Aurana. She wasn’t looking at him, but was instead intensely staring at the old device she held in her hand, small enough to fit in the palm of it. Clunky as it was, he was grateful—it brought them music of the Human kind. For Efyir, this sound was hard to like, but by now Aurana had figured out what he preferred and what he despised. She was far less picky. How they negotiated with one another was often over which song they could agree to listen to together.\nHis father named him Efyir-Azayim, but he had pushed thoughts of his father far from his mind in this moment. He was watching closely to her hand movements on the device. He was trying, politely, not to look at her neck, and failing. Even in the moonlight, the pulses at the top of her exposed neck were unmistakeable. She ignored his gaze and after awhile, began:\n“Promise me…”\n“I’ve made enough false promises between us,” Efyir said abruptly.\nBut Aurana smiled. “Promise me you’ll tell your father. That we ruined the title of his book.”\nImpossible Discourse. Well, it was a start. Not a perfect one.\nShe was again clicking the device, until it finally landed on a song that she knew would please both of them. The earphones were the kind that you stuck in your ear. The one he held fit ill in his Thhiyatkhoor earlobe, but at the right angle the rich sound filed out of the instrument and into his mind. The sound they shared: the other earbud stretched out and was inserted in the ear of a human. Not just a human: a human occupied by a Ks’ou.\nHe tried not to think about that.\nThe song ended. The intentional clicks of the device sounded again as she frantically searched for another song that would be agreeable to them both. He very obviously closed the top of the bottle and rolled it back to her, which she caught without looking up but did not bring to her lips.\n“I’m sorry you will die.” He finally said it. He’d wanted to say it all day. The clicks stopped for only a moment, and then continued again, as if motivated by a frantic compulsion.\n“Don’t be ridiculous. When has a Thhiyatkhoor ever been sorry over a Ks’ou death?” As if to answer her own question, she took a quick sip of water, closed the top and rolled it back to him.\nShe was right. He corrected: “I’m sorry that my actions lead to your untimely death… I still have to truth-tell, per our custom. This is a final battle.”\n“The battle is over. I failed.”\n“The battle isn’t over. It’s shifted.” He wasn’t feeling very argumentative—it seemed to issue naturally whenever he was around her. “It is now towards the life of your human, who will remain after you die tomorrow. And my own life. So I truth-tell… I would like to think the General will be pleased to be corrected on a point that was his life’s work. So, yes, I will tell him. Perhaps he will be compelled to change his title.” That last point was an embellishment. Knowing his father, he wouldn’t.\nShe smiled thinly, still unsatisfied.\n“So promise me…” she spoke, hoping to push him, further. Relentless. Exhausting. Intriguing. “That you’ll tell him how powerful our resistance is? That he won’t need to send a fleet?”\nEfyir could make no such promise. It wasn’t even certain that he would survive this to deliver the message. But he could say, “The General knows the dangers of this. He is fond of humans, against Thhiyatkhoor custom. He will want to protect them as best as possible.”\n“El.” He cringed. The nickname she’d given him once meant more than it did now. She had put the device down so that there was no sound between them, except the rustling of emptiness throughout the sand dunes. “Are we allies?”\nThe branches on his head stretched out into the darkness. They could reach out, like wisps of thread, and feel the air far around them. He could feel the emptiness of plenitude they were compressed between: billions of tiny holes in the sky and billions of rocks below them under the ship, still radiant with the day’s heat.\n“First encounters can never be replicated, and ours was built on the absence of truth. You didn’t tell me what you were. And I didn’t tell you my name.” A burst of sound interrupted. She’d found the song, although he suspected she was compromising, because there were elements he knew she didn’t like. He talked through it. “But sleep is no longer relevant. So… we have a few hours left to try.” He turned to her so that he was looking at the human, directly, and could no longer see the back of her neck where Aurana pulsed discreetly. “If Ana promises me something.”\n“What is that?”\n“That she’ll finish your book. A Brief History of Human Colonization. Even when you die.” This place was miserable. It was still too hot; he could see it on her face. There would be no more arguing. No more sparring, either.\nAurana nodded, then gulped, as if gasping for air. It would be time, soon. There was not enough water for them both. Soon, not enough for any of them. He had forgotten to take a sip, and hoped she hadn’t noticed, either. He pushed the water back in her direction but she stopped it mid-roll, and did not move to lift if to her human’s lips. He did not urge her to drink from it, despite a strange compulsion in him to say so. It wasn’t right. It wasn’t his place.\nThe texts labeled ‘history’ would tell one story—that was certain. His father had learned this lesson the hard way. If only her human could finish the book. Perhaps they could tell another.\n Next Chapter\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/symbiosisnovel/chapters/chapter-1/','title':"Chapter 1 (Kelisfton)",'content':" “Flesh describes an alien entity, a more or less expendable figure…\nits most poignant determination is the extent to which such a body cannot prevent or ward off another\u0026rsquo;s touch. The single-most powerful evidence of the loss of freedom is the fact that bodies lose their integrity and may be \u0026gt;invaded or entered… by coercive power. This touch that we associate with intimacy… becomes instead the power to wound and violate.”\n Hortense Spillers1\n Previous Chapter\nThey were beautiful; I would destroy them.\nThe planet of the newly discovered creatures, the Olyat-Koi, appeared in the screen before me and my team of warrior-Settlers. It was small, with only one continent visible from the exosphere where we lay in wait, and these aliens as I had come to understand them seemed placable enough. Trained in intercepting and decoding messages, I happened upon a Thhiyatkhoor transmission which had given these coordinates. Under the guise to my superiors that I was making a simple investigation, a curiosity about a planet I heard about by rumor, I set a course for the Olyat-Koi homeworld. I didn’t want any nosy overseers following and trying to take over what was rightfully my discovery.\nIf the Thhiyatkhoor were here, they would be so peacefully, as the messages had indicated. I wanted to know what they were doing, and if these new creatures were suitable for settling.\nIn the corner, the short, bipedal creature, with tan flesh and a black nest shooting from its head, began to whimper. The creature, a gift from one of my allies and confidantes, was designated to be used for research missions. But a Commander could use research for only one thing.\nThe whimpering grew louder. Why now? I needed to concentrate. “||Quiet that thing||,” I hissed. Not even my own shell of a settled made such noise as this mewling thing had since the transfer had been made to this ship. A soldier, in an elongated body pinched at the waist, raised one of its weapons, but the ensuing clatter into short creature’s skull would not come. I took one immediate leap and slammed the soldier’s head into the wall, pushing so that a trickle of dark blue blood began to emit from its ears: “||I did not say kill it. I need that thing for my project. Are you trying to sabotage me||?”\n“Adê (No),” the soldier whimpered. It sounded as pathetic as the little creature, now, who had quietened and was looking up at us both with widened eyes. I calculated: I could not afford to lose another soldier, nor was it worth losing patience over what amounted to mere vibrations in the air. I released him so he would slide to the floor. To the short thing I said, “||Carry on your irritating and arbitrary noise-making||,” knowing that the stupid thing didn’t understand my language. This would be remedied when I released my current creature and Settled the small one, connecting to its neural pathways as I was biologically designed to do. But not yet.\nAs if on cue it began making noises again. I conceded that if I were as small as it, with so much exposed flesh despite the long sheet of thin fabric covering from just below the head to its lower body, I would perhaps have cause for worry, too. The Ks’ou and it were not much different in that respect—our bodies are vulnerable, unlike the hardened, mosaic bodies of the multitudinously-formed creature I currently possessed, or—I thought this with an inward joy as I turned my attention back to the screen—the Olyat-Koi, whose bodies were as formidable and strong as their minds. The best hosts were sharp in both, as these were rich resources that the Ks’ou could mine for our own purposes. Lost in the thought of finally landing on the planet, executing the plan, and retrieving the exemplar, I was able to push away the sound of the short creature’s bleats as my mind flooded with images of conquest.\nThis would be a day, perhaps, named after me for celebration. I was saving the Olyat-Koi from their illusions of peace. I would bring the galaxy to them, to hold them honorable above all other species.\nIn case you were wondering: there are no heroes in this story. There are those who do heroic acts, and there are moments of courage. Do not consider any of us heroes; we are all only villains until the very moment of our dying breath, until our being is taken into account.\n Next Chapter\n   Reference lost. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/symbiosisnovel/chapters/chapter-2/','title':"Chapter 2",'content':" Previous Chapter\nNeVarr\u0026ndash;and by default, James\u0026ndash;were standing in front of the tank. The edges on the wide afro of the human glowing slightly aquamarine in its light. The Ks\u0026rsquo;ou formed the humans lips and sent the signals to vibrate the throat: it was a quiet mumble, as they shook a flaky substance onto the open top of the water. A couple of snails were stuck to the side of the tank; the fish that remained from the last fiasco were maneuvering calmly throughout the seagrass that NeVarr had recently planted.\nThey had had cuttlefish some time ago before both Aurana and Ana finally convinced NeVarr to give up once the latest one had died. He mourned a little longer than was appropriate; Aurana reminded him sharply that they weren’t sentient as Ks’ou were. Ana invoked a gentleness that humans were so good at: she knew that the resemblance of Ks’ou to cuttlefish was close, and reminded him that cuttlefish were limited with their eight arms and inability to speak back despite NeVarr’s numerous attempts to detach from his human and crawl into the tank with them and make contact.\nNeVarr refused to believe it at first. “If it’s true they aren’t sentient, how can they have eyes? WE Ks’ou don’t even have eyes. And yet they can’t communicate?”\n“Having eyes and communicating sentiently are two different things.”\nThey thought once he’d given up on cuttlefish-raising that he was done, but he diligently kept the tank thriving, with almost six or seven creatures—two fish, two snails, and some crustaceans—seeming to be swimming happily now that their cuttlefish predator was gone.\nSo was the scene that Aurana, in Ana, walked in to as they returned from their recent KLF solo mission: NeVarr, in James, humming evenly, as though reciting a poem.\n“They can’t hear you,” Aurana said mildly, locking the front door behind them. “And even when we’ve attempted to communicate via our natural tongue in water, all studies have pointed to no signs of conscience.”\nNeVarr ignored her, continuing to speak rhythmically. After a moment, he stood and observed her, noting the blood in her sleeve and gesturing towards his own cheek to show that hers wasn’t quite clean. She dragged her human’s hand against it instinctively; NeVarr sighed, “Do you think it’s true? That we all began on the same planet, even humans? That every thing, in the entire universe, was once… of one kyôsta?”\n“It’s an interesting theory. Unconfirmed and likely uncomfirmable. A creation story, as any other.”\nNeVarr snorted rudely. “You don’t even care for your human’s creation story.”\n“It doesn’t taste,” Aurana responded. Such was the Ks’ou way of interpreting the world, even this one largely devoid of water.\n“Our job as symbiotes is to taste any thing that has been robbed of us,” NeVarr said cooly. “Air thriving. The life of mind. Tasting.”\n“You taste more than most Ks’ou,” Aurana said, grinning thinly, gazing past NeVarr to the kitchen, where a mess invariably await. “What will you do when we are back on kyôsta and you are no longer allowed to eat with a tongue?”\nHe nodded. “It’s the only thing that would convince me to stay on Earth.” Preemptively he held out a hand to stay her shocked expression, “Relax, relax. Obviously we have to leave when the war is over, and that includes leaving our humans, too. I’m just dreaming impossibility. Can I do that, at least?”\nAurana threw their bags on the couch, a gesture she knew would annoy NeVarr to no end, because the only mess he failed to recognize was the one he created in the kitchen. She sat her human’s body down and illuminated the screen, but none of the images that passed sight interested her. It was a far cry than from when she first learned ‘sight,’ as with eyes, when all things were fascinating. Now it was dull; repetitive.\nNeVarr sat himself and his human, James, down next to them on the other side of the couch. They watched in silence for moments before she spoke.\n“You’re dressed like a jackass clown. Are you going to DJ again tonight?”\nShe never looked at him, but could hear him, burning at the cheeks.\nHe made a small choking sound. “Please don’t tell Ana. Is she listening, now?”\n“She’s not listening to us,” Aurana said haughtily. “She’s in the archive.”\n“You know about this? The club?”\n“Ana tells me everything,” Aurana said calmly, tearing her human’s eyes away from the screen to give NeVarr a pointed look. “Unlike some Ks’ou present, I don’t need to take information from my human that she freely gives.”\n“That was only in the beginning,” NeVarr said defensively. His eyes narrowed, as though challenging her. He even licked his lips slightly, his unconscious habit. “Besides…” he frowned, his eyebrows narrowing, “She doesn’t tell you everything.”\n“Doesn’t she?”\nNeVarr had a way of pushing his human’s expression into something unreadable, his eyes were wide and bright. “What’s my favorite food?”\nShe scoffed. “We’re Ks’ou. We’re not supposed to have a single favorite food.”\n“Well, I do. And Ana knows it.” He pushed his human lips into a thin, triumphant line. “Your human doesn’t tell you everything.” He’d said this with an unnecessary finality, returning to the moving light on the screens, but she could tell he wasn’t paying attention.\nAfter some time, NeVarr continued, as though excusing himself, “I’ve limited my club time because of Ana. I’m on call for emergencies only. Only because of what happened…”\n“I know what happened,” Aurana snapped. She didn’t, in fact, but she was testing him. He didn’t fall for it.\n“Kwa. Aurana. Did you know…” he hesitated. “The KLF has charged me. Me. I’m not supposed to inform you, my Sub Aspirant, about it.”\nAurana glanced at him, but his gaze was not directly back at her. Instead, he looked towards the table, where a simple white sheet lay.\n“I’ve only partially deciphered it. But it… I know, already, that it’s beyond anything I’ve ever done. I’m not ready. I can’t do it alone.”\nAurana noted his worry, and, as was typical, did not let emotion overcome her visage. Humans felt much; Ks’ou did, too. It could be embraced without being indulged. “You’ll be fine, NeVarr. This is good news. They want to promote you.”\nNeVarr scoffed. “Or kill me.”\nShe ignored him, “Let’s decipher it completely, together, and then I can help you plan what to do.” He didn’t look fully convinced so she sighed and said, “Remember the Protocols.”\n“You and these Protocols.”\n“They’re useful. I say them to myself when I have trouble sleeping.”\n“There’s something very wrong with you,” he said, arching the eyebrows of his human, but sighed and said, “Just the first two, okay?”\nTogether, they repeated: “Protocol 1. Subset 1. We aim to dismantle the Ks\u0026rsquo;ou Nation, fully and without exception. Protocol 1. Subset 2. We aim to re-establish Ks\u0026rsquo;ou as a peaceful presence in the universe.”\nThere were more, many more. And Protocol Sifr, of course, but that one was so burned into their founds, so foundational, so utterly necessary to everything the KLF aimed to do, that they never found it necessary to say aloud.\nProtocols 1.1. and 1.2 usually sufficed. To remind them what set them apart. To remind them the levity of what they needed to shift. She convinced NeVarr to repeat Protocols 1.1 and 1.2 three times over. The third, NeVarr actually smiled and said, “You’re right. That did make me feel better. So many Ks’ou have failed to succeed at Protocol 1.2. We’re all really bad at it. Why should I expect to do any better?”\n\u0026ndash;\nThe greatest true stories they knew—and Aurana had the greatest repository of stories in the known universe—began with births and deaths. Which is why this begging human, whimpering on his knees, struck them both as a great tragedy.\nEarlier, Aurana and Ana were staring at a single Human face in the mirror: braids to shoulder blades, dark brown eyes, skin that Ana’s mother often said was like sequoias, not just because its shade was a mix between hers and her father’s, but also because these trees were rare, and the last few were isolated in containment for scientific preservation. Apparently they had visited one when she was younger, much younger, but war had devastated most of these. Their trunks remained, and that was why her mother called Ana Sequoia, sometimes, because she believed that, despite struggle, she could remain firmly rooted in herself, her convictions, her family, many of whom she had never met, only holding stories from which she drew threads, senses, sketches.\n{ Your mother was not wrong. }\n{ Stop reading my mind, } Ana snapped, but knew that she had been, once again, thinking too loudly.\nAna took off her earrings, the katydids that most people mistook for leaves, the last visible connection of her first home, the last that she had shared with her sister.\n“My hair needs to be shorter,” Ana grumbled, knowing this was not possible. She regarded her curls, the way they sagged in the mirror, lamenting how tight they could have been were they not so heavy with length.\nAurana did not care much for hair, only to the extent that it covered her human’s neck: { We’re here for the Human. } a gentle reminder. Thoughts were easily lost in tangled webs. NeVarr had already detailed the report on Friday, which meant that Ana had to catch Aurana up today.\n{ Offender on two counts of pro-Nation assaults. Offender of colonial resonance. Offender of Human legally-defined trafficking activities. } Language that was once foreign to Ana had now become everyday words.\n{ So it will be easy, then, } Aurana thought. No need to differentiate between Human and Ks’ou. No need to coax the Ks’ou out, as it were.\n{ Not quite. }\nIt was not difficult infiltrating the hospital. Both the human and the Ks’ou knew already its landscape. Ana’s sister was located in this same building, in another wing, indefinitely, until she recovered or humans decided otherwise. This was the death side of things.\nThe birth? This was currently happening in one room over of the birthing hall of this place. They need only wait for the human father to take a break, to use the restroom, which he did in the 13 hour ordeal that struck Aurana as both lengthy and, given what the human had to deal with, painfully slow.\nKs’ou do not give birth this way. Ks’ou laid eggs to be inspired, and that was that. The event of a Ks’ou birth was not considered an event; Ks’ou were considered ‘born’ in other ways.\nBut here it was—a birth, a presumed death, to come. Ana and Aurana had peeked inside the door while everyone was occupied. Before them both: a human woman, with brown hair intertwined with silver, trying to issue life into human hands, on her back while the body screamed and squirmed. Her intent was to give life; the other life-giver, the biological father, was, however, slated to die. He was situated on the other side of the table, playing his part. The lie was in his presence. They knew the one moving the male, charcoal and grey body wasn’t actually the father: they knew it was a Ks’ou, controlling the human, pretending to be engaged in this beautifully horrific orchestra of human blood and other fluids.\nProper Ks’ou births used to be in etaoin; humans translated this as lagoons but it is not accurate. The Nation, the overarching organization of the Ks’ou species, disrupted this. Soon there was no etaoin. Soon, there was only the call for war, and instead of in etaoin, Ks’ou were born in cold, inorganic ships.\nAnd then it was his time, to succumb to the biological faculties of the human. And their time to strike. She waited until he was in the hallway, and pulled him, unwillingly into another room. Aurana had dressed her human, Ana’s, body in the warrior clothes of the terrorist group they aspired to join, a gift from a mutual friend.\nThe human’s eyes widened at the sight of their uniform. “I know you,” he shuddered. This was a lie: he knew nothing about her. He knew of her, but no more. She was a new subject, and attacked him accordingly. In moments that they tumbled she had freed the human, temporarily, from Ks’ou control.\n“Choose, human,” Aurana hissed when the blinking, confused human entered the reality that the Ks’ou had denied him. Ana readied her body for their transfer; death came from her, the human, alone.\n“I know you can’t answer this,” this father-to-be said, “But how strong are you? The KLF? I just… is freedom close? Would it be worth it, to wait, for my daughter?”\n“You’re right,” she said, looking away for fear that her terrible awkwardness for lying would betray information that she couldn’t give. “I can’t answer that. But I can tell you this: don’t look to the KLF for your freedom. It is something humans will secure for yourselves, from your own colonizer.”\n“Yeah,” he mumbled, the sobriety of it like a brick struck against his face. He began twitching.\n“Your Ks’ou will regain control soon,” she said. “I’m sorry, We need your decision.”\n“I don’t have an answer,” he said, finally, holding up a hand, extending and retracting it as though he were testing to see the very moment that it would return to control of the Ks’ou. “I want to see my baby girl. But I don’t want this monster to lay a finger on her.” He laughed, sadly, as though he had just made a great joke. “My wife has always accused me of being impatient.”\nJust then they could hear her very screams through the wall, not quite the blood-curdling scream of a human whose life was about to end; this sounded closer to a great and powerful cry, peaking, apparently, to the crowning finality of a newborn birth.\n—\nA Brief History of Human Colonization\nIt is clear that the Ks’ou alien Colonizers functioned as a disruption to the Human historical timeline. Humans, Earth-wide, would never be the same as before the Ks’ou arrived on Earth, and the nature of Ks’ou control would obliterate and disrupt Human-driven possibility. This has never before been made so clear as the introduction of the terms ‘Pre-Ks’ou Era’ (PKE) and ‘Post-Ks’ou Era’ (PsKE) in many Earth-published textbooks; though these terms are charged and used sparingly here, it should be noted that this work before you is written in 39 PsKE. The small years of the Ks’ou failed attempt at colonization will be simply referred to as ‘KE.’ To be sure, Humans were colonizers before the arrival of the Ks’ou. Not all Human colonization can be considered the same across all Human contexts.1 The title of this work is not to imply that ‘Human’ indicates an essential, singular form of colonization. That ‘Human’ serves as a metonym for ‘all’ or ‘universal’ is an unfortunate implication in some (though not the majority of) Human languages. The purpose of this work is to explore the nature of Human-driven colonization across different geographical, political, and cultural contexts on the third planet from Sol (formerly the ambiguously named ‘Sun’) in the Human Solar System within the galaxy that Humans refer to as the Milky Way. By privileging the era of Human history before the Ks’ou arrival, when time was designated ‘CE’ or ‘AD’ and ‘BCE’ or ‘BC’, the authors aim to provide initial thoughts toward how Human colonization shaped the reaction towards subsequent Ks’ou colonization. Through the lens of the writers, the PKE can never fully be torn apart from the PsKE, though the former was never fully shaped by it, either. Across the galaxy, may we be comforted in the fact that all species share one trait: we are all the artifacts of our histories, whether we remember this history or not…\n—\nTheir path home was pervaded by the quiet sound of water flickering off leaves. The temperature was dropping, but slowly, so that they trudged over the muddy floor of a forest between seasons. Beads of water still clung to the edges of branches, like unsettled dust. They both felt that it was good to be engulfed by something taller, something bigger than themselves. This had the power to ease a heart likewise engulfed in quiet war. Their shadows, and the dim light through the tops of the trees, had a calming effect.\nIt was when they approached the clearing that they saw it—there, on the top of the trees, the slender body, the ridged head and, though an outline of a shadow, a set of horns extending from the back of its head called naghryoja. It was aiming a weapon: Aurana could see the glint of the moon on its surface.\nShe slipped her own weapon out of her pocket, extended it, and aimed. Not many Thhiyatkhoor graced the Earth these days, enough in number only that this chance encounter did not seem out of place. What was this one doing so high in this tree? Did it not know not to expose itself? Of course. Typical Thhiyatkhoor arrogance. Earth was hardly a threat, though she had heard of Human attempts to kidnap Thhiyatkhoor for money—most by now surely realized that Thhiyatkhoor did not discourse in Human sums, that battle was their currency. If one were to fell a Thhiyatkhoor on accident, adequate payback would involve dealing with their enemies, the greatest of these the Ks’ou, rivals from the beginning.\nBut a purposeful kidnapping? Aurana was tempted. She would never give him over to the miserable Nation, but the Ks\u0026rsquo;ou Liberation Front could use him for their aims to upend and defeat the Ks’ou force currently wreaking its havoc on Humans; Ks’ou anti-Nation liberators wanted an end to the war that had devastated their people, that had destroyed the Universe’s consideration of their species.\nAurana aimed, but the glint of the object the Thhiyatkhoor held caught her eye. Was it really a weapon? Through the pistonet’s viewer she adjust for a closer look. The object that she imagined was a weapon seemed round and clear, except for inside. There, they saw a swirling sphere, deep blue and green and brown as lush planets are, and there were clouds as well as light streaks, a shining lace of phosphoric luminescence, that cut through the bodies of terra.\nUnlike Earth, this planet’s landmass was largely connected in a band that clustered toward the center, a band that humans would refer to as an ‘equator’. Many peninsulas speckled the large bodies of water north and south of this center, but they were hardly visible in this opthastre.\nIt didn’t matter. There it was, entirely.\nkyôsta!\nShe imagined that she had thought this, but as her ears trembled, she realized that this Thhiyatkhoor was saying it also, over and over again; his narrow, sharp lips moved in the dark. She shifted the viewer towards his head instead, to discern his expression, and to see his mouth, if it were true what she was too far away to hear.\nHer finger slipped.\nShe could see the shot, though tiny, tearing the air apart.\nAurana stood her human’s body in frozen horror. She had never unintentionally triggered her weapon before—was always precise, until now.\n{ Don’t worry. I got you. } Ana whispered her assurance. Aurana dared to look upwards and understood: Ana had sensed the mistake she was about to make, shifted her physical hands so the shot missed him by moments. The Thhiyatkhoor was, thankfully, unscathed, but he was now looking directly towards them.\nWhen they looked through the viewfinder again, the Thhiyatkhoor was gone. She could see the movement of the trees but could not hear its rustling, could barely hear the deftness as he tore, quietly, through the branches at an impossibly quick speed. Anxiety gripped her; she did not fear, was accustomed to battle, but she did not have enough information to discern how she should prepare for what would occur next. She knew that running would be foolish—Thhiyatkhoor were excellent tree-runners—but to remain would risk a provocative wrath. She could only stand still to see what kind of Thhiyatkhoor this one was. The leaves that rustled sounded as the wind; she could not discern where, exactly it was, until a sudden shake just in front of her.\nThe creature swung down in a simultaneous stomp of both its legs, only minute spaces in front of her. Thhiyatkhoor are not particularly beautiful creatures: with slim, angular bodies and little shapeliness except for the sharp of their arm blades, there was not much to them except outline. Aurana concluded that they were like muscular seaweed— perhaps dangerous muscular seaweed. Ana of course disagreed: she liked the Thhiyatkhoor crown, as she called it, but these, even round, were only an extension of Thhiyatkhoor, and not the Thhiyatkhoor itself. Humans at least had a little roundness that made sense. Yet being Ks’ou and thus born without sight, it ultimately didn’t matter: who was she to judge what was pretty and what wasn’t?\nHe brought forward his three formidable arm blades; struck against her small weapon she now used as a tiny shield. She swung her other arm and missed, purposefully, to show him a rhythm he did not understand, causing enough confusion for her to deal a blow to his jaw. He was unfazed; her human’s hand throbbed. As they clashed again, he leaned in close as though to intimidate her. His blades could fell thick branches, and her weapon, though long enough to act as a thin shield, was beginning to give. He was obviously warrior class, notably in the interim pauses of this initial scuffle, the ways his eyes shifted over the body of her human, assessing speed and estimating their next movements.\nShe knew, also, that this attack was restrained, so it was no surprise when the caveat came, his eyes shining night against night. “You attempt an attack?”\nHe spoke low. Thhiyatkhoor voices tended to be tonic; their throats and palates are curved differently than humans, so it made it notoriously difficult for humans to understand what Thhiyatkhoor found important, and lead to many different misunderstandings between the history of their races. No misunderstanding as deep as between Ks’ou and Thhiyatkhoor, though. The sound that Aurana was so used to—a sound had become normal to her, like rushing water, a high-pitched hum, that had nestled itself into the creases of her mind, suddenly diminished, like a wave breaking suddenly to become calm. The voice of this Thhiyatkhoor cut through it like the bow of a ship through saltwater. It was the first thing she noticed about him. But she couldn’t stay with this thought long enough to make it salient, and so quickly forgot it.\n“Yy- You’re a Thhiyatkhoor.” She could try to feign ignorance. So said the stupidest thing that came to mind. His response did not disappoint.\n“Obviously.” His slate flared superiority. A brief shine over a slower diffused cloudburst, like grey and white wisps passing aside a full moon. Ana had only seen Thhiyatkhoor in books, so Aurana took her awe at his skin emotions and expressed it as her own.\n“What are you doing on Earth?”\n“What are you doing with that weapon?”\n“Nothing,” she said, exaggerating her human’s embarrassment. She held up both arms, the weapon dangling from the thumb of one, wondering how many details of her face he could see in the light wind. “A misfire. I’m sorry. I’ve never seen a live Thhiyatkhoor before.”\nFor her this was a lie, and she was still learning how to do these, but what did a Thhiyatkhoor know of good or bad lying in a Human context? He hesitated, regarded her with his dark eyes. The sphere—humans referred to it as an opthastre and she couldn’t remember the word in Endaithsu—glowed in his hand.\n“Can I see it?” she asked honestly. “The thing, you have—the marble. I will lay my weapon down; honest, I only was using it as a telescope to see what you were holding in the moonlight, and I did not know the trigger was activated.”\nAs a “Human,” she placed her weapon on the ground timidly. Aurana was invoking every aspect of Ana, the early Ana, the pre-war child, the unborn, that she could.\n“We are in a time of peace,” she said. Earth’s unprecedented peace—even for Earth—was propaganda, of course, begun by humans themselves and now perpetuated by Settlers. But at 39 PsKE, human memory waned, and now that more of the universe was open to them, so, too, the whelm of distraction.\n“Excessive peace,” the Thhiyatkhoor mumbled. He glanced at the opthastre. “It is civilian grade.” Reluctantly, he placed it into her hands, while staring directly at her grounded weapon as he did. The opthastre, close to 3 inches in diameter, contained within it the real-time projection of an image that she thought she’d never see in her lifetime.\n“This is my place of origin, my kyôsta,” he said as she held up the swirling planet to her eyes. He glanced towards her ear and neck, but it was useless: though she did not sport the zilaa2 sign, she wore a scarf that covered her neck and the edge of her ear, and was still firmly wrapped there despite the intensity of this initial battle. “Kyôsta being the word for ‘home’ in my native language.”\n“I figured that.” Her tone was coarse, but she looked at this creature, this tall, slate, Thhiyatkhoor, the shadows of his adolescent naghryoja cutting against the stars in the backdrop. Gauged him. “Do you miss it?”\n“My Human hosts have been as family to me since before I formed branches. But when I see what my planet looks like from the outside, perhaps that thing you call ‘missing’ is what I experience.”\nShe twitched, annoyed. It is not your planet, she wanted to sneer. Not alone. But Thhiyatkhoor speak this way, of course, because they have succeeded in making, marking, and manifesting their planet as their own. He was between child and adulthood, likely similar to her own interplanetary measure of passing. She pushed aside these political thoughts and regarded the sphere, which held an image she had hardly seen; Ks’ou were not allowed to think of this kyôsta as kyôsta-sy, though it framed their indigeneity.\nIt had been years since she had even seen her own planet of her birth, but this was different: she had never seen projections of the original kyôsta such as this. Spheres of this kind were not technology bestowed to her species.\nShe held it back out to him, with some resistance, “Thank you. Your so-called kyôsta is a beautiful place. Perhaps Humans can visit one day.” This laughable proposition was something Ana was thinking, loudly, and therefore a real text that Humans might speak.\n“Perhaps.” He made a rude sound, one that Aurana likened to scoffing; wordlessly, he took the sphere back. What more did he want? Argument? Understanding? Meaning? But he seemed stalled. She picked up her weapon again and stuffed it into her pocket to begin heading out of the forest starred.\n Next Chapter\n   Wolfe, Patrick. “Comparing Colonial and Racial Regimes.” 2013 lecture. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwj5bcLG8ic \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n zilaa: Non-Earther (a term from Izlaa, the Universal language) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/symbiosisnovel/chapters/chapter-2star/','title':"Chapter 2*",'content':" Previous Chapter\nAna Joseph and Aurana~\nSpring PsKE 39, 2—-\nDr. Hagåtña\nA Brief History of Human Colonization\n‘Chronotope’ (Time-Space) is a theory by the ancient Russian thinker M. M. Bakhtin (citation needed). He argues that Narration can be looked at separately through the lense of these two different relationships: temporal (time) and spatial (space). These two components express a particular worldview or ideology depending on the genre of literature you find it in. [is this sentence necessary?] However, the time and space components of chronotope are not easily separated, and I will argue that this unsettling connection between time and space shows the ways that colonization has unsettled [try \u0026lsquo;disrupted’—less weird, you know…] Human civilization since the beginning of time. Colonizers aim to dominate and reconfigure the chronotope of other cultures and peoples. [yes.] Though there are varying types of colonization, if there is one tenet that all colonization shares, it is this…\nProfessor Hagåtña1 lifted her eyes from the paper to gaze at Ana directly. The professor’s brown eyes contrasted well with the dark green rims of her glasses, framed by curly black hair and skin like saturated elm. “Seems a little ambitious for a senior capstone.”\nAna tried not to feel small. Mama and Papa Joseph taught her to be fairly comfortable in this minute academic world, but Dr. Hagåtña was sharp and serious, someone who did smile on occasion, only when she intended to and usually at her own humor. There were other differences in this world, too: Ana tried to hide her shoes beneath the chair, they would not last through winter but the duct tape should hold up for a few more weeks as long as it didn’t snow too often. She took care to keep the upper half of her body presentable, wearing a dark blue blazer and keeping her braids tidy and tight, as Mama taught.\n“I’d like to think of it as a lifetime project. I would just lay out the groundwork for this class, get started, you know.” She needed this project approved so she wouldn’t have to work with Dr. Jayco. Dr. Hagåtña was one of few professors at the University who looked somewhat similarly to Ana, and the only one who likely had enough savvy to know how she could navigate it.\nDr. Hagåtña’s eyes dropped again as she surveyed the summary that Ana had hastily typed out that morning on her Univ-pod, having forgotten the assignment was due at all. Aurana had to follow through and make corrections, all too late. The reminder from her Ks\u0026rsquo;ou was one of many times she was grateful to be co-inhabited—a nagging voice who would help her recall all she’d forgotten.\n{ You’d do better if you would just update your calendar, } Aurana hissed. { Why are Humans so terrible at time? It would take one minute, of which you have 960 per average waking— }\n{ Shhh! You’re not supposed to read my mind! }\n{ I’m not. You think as loudly as you speak. And no one has ever referred to you as quiet, if I recall. }\n{ Shhhh! }\nAna blinked. Dr. Hagåtña was staring at her curiously. She must have said something that Ana hadn’t heard in the outer-body aloud. “I… I’m sorry, Professor. Could you repeat the question?”\nHer professor’s eyebrows raised, slightly, lifting her spectacles just up over the ridges of the wrinkles on her forehead. She repeated, “Who is Aurana?”\nAna gulped. She had insisted that the very Ks’ou who controlled her body be included in the authorship, because of the archive. Without thinking about having to explain what the name was doing there in the first place. “My sister.”\n“You’ve referred to her as Éloise in the times you’ve mentioned her in class.”\nCurse her formidable memory! Ana thought quickly. “It is. But that was my nickname for her. A joke. She was born seconds after me. So I started calling her After-Ana, A-r-ana. The name stuck.”\n{ …what an excellent lie. } Aurana mused, impressed.\nAna felt somewhat self-satisfied, too, when she noticed how Dr. Hagåtña nodded, the slight curve of the corners of her mouth peaking. “Clever.” The curves disappeared. “But why is she a co-author?”\n“My… I talk with my sister about it.”\n“With?”\n“I mean to. I talk to her. She doesn’t talk back, obviously.”\n“Obviously.”\nAna was beginning to despite that word. “But I really want her to be on there. She’s helped me so much. I wouldn’t be here if she didn’t urge me to attend college. And we’ve always talked about colonization with each other. So she should get credit.”\n“If only more academics thought as you did,” Dr. Hagåtña muttered dryly. “You wrote and tried, desperately, to edit this at the last minute, I see. Let me read through and see if I can piece together something logical out of these syntactic disasters.”\nAna held her breath, waiting for the professor’s final answer. In the silence she began to fumble around with the cotton gloves in her lap, the kind that were open halfway so that her fingers poked through. When she tried them on and wiggled her fingers in, Aurana had joked that the gloves made it look as though she had tendrils just as her own.\nTendrils was the word that they had finally decided on; ‘tentacles’ was the word that Aurana first used, but Ana had to correct her, arguing that they had a creepy undertone.\n{ Appendages, then, } Aurana had said. She had very little patience for the richness of the English language, and a particularly unhealthy disdain for synonyms.\n{ That’s also a weird word. }\n{ Why do Humans make perfectly fine words into oddities? They are simply words, they point to a thing and that is all. Weird words are arbitrary! }\n{ Let’s just say tendrils. Tendrils sound nice. Like tender. }\n{ Arbitrary. } Aurana had insisted again.\nDr. Hagåtña finally finished decorating Ana’s paper with the blood-red violence of semi-constructive criticism. She handed it back; Ana could breathe. Approved with major adjustments was scribbled across the top. Her mother would be proud; she couldn’t wait to tell her, imagined her round and shining arms lifting up energy into the air, “Kreyol: ||Nou pa sèl ki ka fonn pa lapli2!||” Aurana was ecstatic and weary at once.\n“You’re a promising student, and it will be a necessary contribution to the field, as long as you give yourself parameters,” the professor said. “Give me something more concrete—and not written at the last minute—by next week’s class.”\n“Thank you, Dr. Hagåtña,” Ana said, shoving the paper into her backpack and standing to leave.\n“Ana…”\nAna grimaced. She hoped her professor would just return to her screen as she normally did, with that distant look in her eyes indicating that her mind had already shifted to other pressing abstractions. This was the third professor who had spoken to her in that tone of voice.\n“I am concerned about your engagement in this class,” she said. “You are often distracted. You hesitate to speak though it is clear you have much to say. Is there something about the class that is disappointing you?”\nDr. Hagåtña usually framed things in the context that mattered most to her.\n“It’s not the class,” Ana forced a thin smile to show she was genuine. Of course, she couldn’t tell her professor about the alien currently residing in the interstices of her brain, the alien whose appenda—ahem, tendrils—had curled and curved their way from the cerebral cortex up through the synapses. The alien who lay unseen, except for a small bump on her neck hidden by the scarf she wore, but listening in to this very conversation. “I’m engaged, promise.”\n“I’m not allowed to make assumptions, but I can say that having difficulty concentrating could indicate a larger problem. If you need resources, I can direct you to Mentality Services, or the Abilities Office. They serve all species—”\nAna grimaced inwardly; chewed her lip. She drew back and Aurana did not miss a beat, taking over her Human’s mouth, “Dr. Hagåtña, I am Human, and I am just fine. Last week you reframed James Baldwin’s Talk to Teachers in our context today. That 2—- is a time where we are at a further loss for our identities because we couldn’t figure out who we were, we couldn’t figure out our vision for ourselves as a species, before aliens came. Writing this book is my vision for humans. If I can configure colonization in Human’s past, then we can contend with the resonances of the Ks’ou’s failed attempt at colonization today.”\n{ Applause-worthy elevator speech. }\n{ Perhaps it is time you pay better attention in class. }\n{ Yep. Mmm.. noted. }\nDr. Hagåtña was smiling at her—if only the professor knew she was smiling at two beings at once. While her eyes were direct, she made a motion with her lips as though wanting to say something, but chose not to respond directly. “Good day, then.” The distant look in her eyes pulled her away and she turned towards the books on her shelves, as though Aurana were never there.\nAurana was fairly certain that the professor wasn’t inhabited, but she always wore a high collar, and in winter when everyone’s necks was covered for warmth, one could never really know—unless you had access to the Ks’ou database. That would require an unnecessary hacking, and their time was occupied plenty by other, more necessary ones.\nAurana sent a small trill through their shared minds. { A co-author! This is exciting. We are making a text! I’ll be the first published Ks’ou! }\n{ It’s just a school project. It’s not a big deal, } Ana reminded her, but she took one look out the window and finished relinquishing to Aurana. They were headed outside, where it had, to Ana’s chagrin and the ultimate destruction of her boots, began to snow. Aurana hated the cold, but she was fascinated by ‘solid water’, liked to saunter through it. By the time they had finished pushing open the doors to the outside, Aurana now controlled her entire body, not just her mouth as the final moments back in the professor’s office. Ana, though she was still able to see, did not have to feel a hint of cold.\nThey headed towards their next class, a certain Professor Jayco who was far less intimidating—but also less interesting—than Dr. Hagåtña. { Still. A book that needs to be written. Humans and your lack of knowledge. Why does it take alien colonization for you to set yourselves straight? }\n{ Pot. Kettle. }\n{ A fair point, } Aurana grumbled, but Ana could always hear that small hint of admiration in her voice, a tone that resonated even as they spoke through each other’s minds. It was snowing more heavily now, the kind of abundant snow that populated the campus grounds in heaps and seemed to absorb all sounds of Humans and movement and monument around them. Veroia was a medium-sized university, the only of its kind, as Professor Hagåtña had said, to “serve all species,” which was a misuse of the term ‘all’ but very common for humans to overstate their aims. It had no shortage of posters with faces of smiling humans and human-appearing aliens in living fakes, with their necks bent in awkward angles so that the zilaa signatory was obvious, the words “Earth’s first public institution integrating species in the same learning environment,” emblazoned as its caption. Veroia promised a more inclusive, diverse education; it was also the perfect place for Ks’ou to do their affairs more or less conspicuously as the Nation machine marched forward. The campus was large enough so that it was easy to disappear as a student; the snow that fell on its campus only added to this effect. It was so quiet, in fact, that they almost didn’t hear the muffled cursing from across the courtyard. They stopped completely and stared as the two figures in navy enforcement suits, their ranks given away by the cotton-colored armband slashed with Ks’ou blue, wrestled with a blonde boy. They were dragging away a Settleds, a student she had recognized only briefly from the Ks’ou Deep. Enforcement had waited until he was in the POD and trapped; likely, Aurana ventured, he was being sent for reprimanding for some infraction.\nAna was quiet. There were some words that didn’t need exchanging. They both agreed tacitly, for example, that the book they were writing for her capstone was a distraction from the other colonization that was happening—the global, quiet colonization, from the inside out.\nRemnants from the war that Humans wrongly believed they’d won.\n\u0026ndash;\n“But what about the Ks’ou?”\nThe entire class was staring at her, but Aurana didn’t care if she uttered the word that seemed so forbidden, as though not mentioning Ks’ou would somehow make that sore spot in Human history disappear. She glared back at the students: several were clearly zilaa, including the awkward boy with pepper hair, non-human and suppressed in the human-seeming encasements that zilaa were forced to wear.\nYet most were Human: sleepy-eyed. Gangly. Apathetic—until it impacted their personal lives. Awhile ago Ana took offense at this description of her people until Aurana gave line-by-line evidence, and at that point Ana was ready to declare herself—though she couldn’t, really—not-fully-human.\nWhat ABOUT the Ks’ou? This was a nuance they needed to interrogate and the professor was deliberately dancing around the question.\n“Yes, well,” Professor Jayco coughed and adjusted his glasses. He seemed to be a very nervous Human, with a fancy bald spot that seemed out of place with his youthful visage, dressed in a suit that seemed slightly too big for him. “It is true that the Ks’ou were known for stealing technology, though never for financial gain since the monetary system as we understand it is a Human invention.”\n“So would you say Humans and Ks’ou alike share a history of stealing technology?” she pressed. Some of the Humans finally stirred in response to her words and glared at her, those who understood the point she was trying to make.\n“That might be… glossing over… details,” the professor said weakly. “Perhaps we can discuss this after class.”\n{ Don’t slay him too hard, } Ana told her half-jokingly. { He looks like he went from diapers to degree. }\nAurana snickered internally. Aloud she said, “Perhaps. I merely want to press on the point that the sanctions on Humans for stealing technology from the Thhiyatkhoor and selling it for profit are marginal compared to the current sanction on Ks’ou. Technology-related deaths increase exponentially each year and we fail to address it because of our general preference for Humans as a species. We should analyze our personal biases when addressing crucial issues such as technological plagiarism.”\n“Nn-noted,” the professor squeaked. “I think we should continue with the lesson.”\nBut one of the zilaa boys—whose name she hadn’t bothered learning—spoke then. He was new, having just arrived in the middle of the semester only a couple weeks ago. His dark curls were entwined with a silver color that was not of his age, and long enough to hang over his ears but not his neck. It was usually the first thing both Ana and Aurana checked briefly with discerning eyes—smooth neck skin, prominently displayed, he was most certainly not Settled. Ana referred to his skin color as ‘ambiguous,’ whatever that meant. Like leather, his skin was brûlée. He tended to be quiet, so both Ana and Aurana were surprised when he offered the harsh, loud claim, “Are you a Ks’ou sympathizer?”\nShe glared at him, trying not to touch the scarf she always wore, a move which might bring unwarranted attention to her neck. A few other students murmured—in approval, it sounded—with this comment. This was a dangerous accusation. To be a Ks’ou sympathizer on Earth was nothing light; the few who existed had been silenced, often violently, so much so that the minority that remained no longer spoke openly. One of the mighty warriors of the first great battle on Earth against Ks’ou had been rumored to hold Ks’ou sympathies, but she no longer spoke publicly.\n“I am merely asking legitimate questions. Unlike yours.” She snapped her head to challenge him with her eyes, eyes that told him to bring his best argument. His eyes, also brown, stared back at her widely, but not harshly. “Are humans beyond critique?”\nShe had long suspected that he was zilaa—a non-Earther—just by the few remarks he would offer in class and his blatant misunderstanding of Humans. Once he’d claimed that Humans were all electronics-toilers, which was clearly false, even in the small metropolis they were in. Another time he’d referred to Humans as bipedals, a somewhat derogatory term if anyone thought about it long enough.\nNon-bipedal. That was all she knew of his species, but it wasn’t enough. There were monopeds and quadrupeds, and plenty more in between. Her own species, as water-born, did not even identify with this idea of ‘pedal’. For pedaled species, the default is to think in terms of feet. Wasn’t the mind just as sound?\n“Of course not,” he finally said, his eyes flickering. “Humans earn critique as much as any species. By what measure do you critique them?”\nThis was a trap, she recognized. The measure she chose might reveal the fact that she was zilaa, too, or even her species, and of course she could not measure against atrocities that humans had committed against any species but her own. Her response would reveal what she was, and with that, who.\nSo she raised her chin and said, “I measure us by our contribution to the universe. And so far we humans contribute much to those we identify as our own, and little to those we identify as our Other.” She’d hope the lie would pass, and for many in the public eye, it seemed to.\nWhile he was unsatisfied with this response, the professor was now begging them to sit so they could finish their lesson before the next exam. Humans loved tiny tests that did not involve battle or blood, and it was perhaps a safer way to test one’s competence, but boring; nonetheless, they resigned.\nWhen class ended he seemed insistent on finishing the conversation. He followed close after her as she hurried out the door, “I have a book you should read, written by a Thhiyatkhoor General. It details—”\n“What’s your name?” she interrupted sharply, then kept walking, heading towards the exit. She hoped that it had stopped snowing so that her Humans’ boots would survive the twenty minute walk.\n“Uh…” he reddened, as though unsure. They reached the double glass doors at the exit; here, her hopes for a ceased snowfall were dashed. She stopped pull her coat out of her bag as she waited for what should have had an immediate answer.\n“Ef.”\nAurana blinked, unsure if he was insane or trying to be funny as she pulled the coat over her shoulders. The mop-haired boy shifted his bi-pedaled weight uncomfortably.\nShe’d heard this, and repeated: “Elf?”\nHe heard the ‘l’, hesitated but realized this might be an advantage. ‘Elf’ over ‘Ef.’ “Yes. Elf. With an l like liquid. Llllll.” She stared; he continued talking. “It is longer, but I have been taught that I must truncate my name.”\nShe smirked. “Sure. But ‘Elf’ is a thing on this planet, a tiny and ridiculous creature. Do you not know?” His expression told her that he didn’t. “Perhaps El, then, might be a better fit. Just a suggestion, in case you don’t want too many to know you are zilaa.”\n“Perhaps.” He—his engineered Human-appearing skin, rather—deepened crimson. “Pretty obvious?”\n“Only just so,” she said, unsure that he picked up on the sarcasm. “I’ve read the book you mentioned, written by the Thhiyatkhoor General Shyridin? Spectacular storytelling, peppered with colorful myth. It is no wonder it reached the top of the Interstellar Bestseller list—pure stilled water.” He didn’t react so she continued, more firmly, “No Thhiyatkhoor should be trusted to write on the Ks’ou. Their two histories have been too violently entangled for too long.”\n“I think that is exactly why they should be trusted with it.” He was stubborn, his words edged by a strange, soft kind of belligerence where he seemed to be arguing with no one but himself.\n“Then would you tolerate a novel about the Thhiyatkhoor written by a Ks’ou?” she challenged.\nHe thought for a moment. “I could perhaps be bothered to read work by a Ks’ou sympathizer.” What was he? As she puzzled over his words, trying to find in her inventory a species to match, he caught her off guard, “For zilaa, you do a good job of holding humans accountable.”\n“What makes you say that?” Aurana visibly sank into her scarf. She’d spoken a little too quickly, and was embarrassed to see El’s crooked smile, triumph she wanted to erase from his face with a quick blow. Ana mumbled a few words to her to calm her down.\n“Most Humans find me pretty intolerable within the first minute, but you somehow have continued talking to me.”\nShe stared at him for a moment; Ana was roaring with laughter and she was trying to hold her Human’s face straight. “I find you decently intolerable,” she said, looking away so that he couldn’t see her face for her long braids. “My name is Aurana.”\n“I thought it was Ana?”\nHmm. So he listened in class more than he let on. “Yes. That is my truncated name, as yours.” She glanced outside; the snow gave no sign of letting up. Visitor’s Hours would be over if she didn’t hurry. “I do have to go.”\nEl nodded. “Tomorrow, after my Ecology of Alien Invasions class, maybe we can talk about General Shyridin’s book together. I’d like to hear more of what you disliked about it.”\n“Pffff,” there were many things about Humans that she liked. One of them was how you could make breathy sounds instead of using full words and still be understood; it was clear, however, by his blank expression that El wasn’t so well versed in that, either. No idioms, no sounds—how long had he been on this planet? She tugged on her scarf a bit so it hugged more tightly around her neck before she stepped out into the snow, “Sure. I have enough footnotes for a book of my own.”\n Next Chapter\n   See Guampedia, entry Hagåtña https://www.guampedia.com/hagatna/ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n “We are not statues of salt to be dissolved by rain!” See Simone Schwartz-Bart, Pluie et vent sur Télumée Miracle (With thanks from the author to my colleague Rashana Lydner for the Hatian Kréol translations.) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/symbiosisnovel/chapters/chapter-3/','title':"Chapter 3",'content':" Previous Chapter\nNot all heroes die in a fantastic blaze of light.\nSome die quite normally, with facility. Closed eyes and a simple, unperturbed decision to shift, to decay into the next mode of being.\nSuddenly, in the middle of the night, from a lung that refuses to fill, or a heart that refuses to beat, organs consumed by the slow burn of existence.\nSome die in the dark, alone. The hunter become the hunted.\nAs you know, when my father eventually died, he did not get to choose the manner of death. He was in fact not far from my position on Earth, and his proximity would haunt me for a long time to come. He did not die in a glorious battle; it was a small skirmish compared to a lifetime of excellent engagement in war. He would die, I had first imagined, by the hands of the creatures whom he had committed his life to destroying. A lucky shot from a large Ks’ou ship refusing to follow Thhiyatkhoor protocol. They returned fire before their own ship exploded, enemy eliminating enemy at once.\nThere was no great battle to be won. No hero story to tell. Not even an individual that I could use to avenge my father’s death.\nBefore the incident, my last words to my father were, “I disown you.”\nAnd his to me, “It is a good thing, young Efyir, that our people do not allow sons to disown their fathers. But you will refer to me as General in lieu of father until you have regained sense.”\nHe ended transmission at that moment. The final exchange between father and son in our interminable battle for mutual respect.\nIn re-encountering his final transmission, I realized that I misjudged a great many things about him.\nMy only hope was that, before his death, he realized that he had misjudged me. That he lived in a different time than I did, and was indeed, against me in chronotopic resonance. His ally in the first war, the Human Kahti, the remainder of their particular era, seemed to think so.\nI was temporarily expatriated to Earth as a punishment for disobedience. I was to learn from my father’s friend, Kahti, and her daughter—my sister-without-crown—about Human ways. My father found his time on Earth, just as his ekhair after whom I was named, necessary to his formation as Thhiyatkhoor. His philosophy was that one could not understand their own people until they began to understand another’s.\nIt took me many years to realize that his philosophy and my own were ultimately, at their ends, the same.\nHowever, my father’s mistake, which I, eventually, would not to repeat, was this:\nHe refused to learn from our enemy, the Ks’ou.\n—\n“|If you think history flatters you,||” General Shyridin was saying, “||Then you are impaled on your history like a butterfly on a pin.1 You are incapable of seeing or changing yourself or the world. These words come from the Human James Baldwin in Earth Year they call 1965 Anno Domini, for them; these words which resonate with many species today. Do we find ourselves, us Thhiyatkhoor, impaled? Do we find us feeding ourselves the lies of inhumility? Or are we committed to dismantling ourselves from the bias of our speciesisms? In other words, how do we carry our history within us?||”\nEfyir-Azayim sank lower in his chair as the General spoke.\n“||Qwa, what is a butterfly||?” someone whispered loudly behind him.\n“||An Earth insect with four, easily breakable wings. Don’t you pay attention in our Anthropology of Carbon-Based Earthen Lifeforms class?||” another hissed.\n“||No. What does an Earth-bound butterfly have to do with us?||”\nThe class had been filled with an eager energy at first, but the more words were said, the more unfamiliar it seemed to the rest, who were sure to find these so very Human, so very un-Thhiyatkhoor-like. Some of their kind had begun to smirk, shown as diffused cloudbursts on their slate. Others began to whisper, both great- and few-branched individuals, glancing from Efyir back to the General, and passing along words with unkind eyes.\nGeneral Shyridin had a commanding physical presence. His head-naghryoja, well-curated, twisted and circular, sported twenty offshoots, unheard of for most Thhiyatkhoor; he was tall, and the scar he sported across his face, a near-fatal attack, was a testimony to his many years in war. It was odd for him to be appearing alone; but then again, not entirely out of place, for who he was as General.\nHis advisors had counseled him to stand without speaking, that by merely looking he could communicate more than were he were to open his mouth, but this was something he refused to do. He had much to say, and felt the drag of time that might keep him from saying it. So it was that the General continued speaking, boldly, as though not noticing the diminishing return of energy in each room he spoke in such as this one.\n“||The Thhiyatkhoor have led excellent legacies, and won many wars. Yet we suffer from an arrogance which keeps us content, as though our political status in the universe, and ability to win wars, will continue indefinitely. I warn you—our approaches must change, we must consider the mediation of other successful species such as Humans, if we are to continue thriving.||”\nThere were embarrassed glances shot in Efyir’s direction, though no one, not even his closest ekhair, or non-blood-brother, would say a word to him or look at him in his black eyes directly. What Thhiyatkhoor invokes the means and manners of other species in order to conduct their work? The General, it was now agreed, had spent far too much time on Earth, away from his true species, to speak to his own people.\nPer Thhiyatkhoor custom, no one would dare challenge the General with direct insult. But it could be done with subtlety, which the lagoon-toiler Taghyr was known for. When it came time for questions, he was the first in line. Efyir longed for the time when those people were not allowed at such events. But tides were changing, and to combat the universe’s diminishing opinion of Thhiyatkhoor, it was seen as a great gesture of inclusion to allow lagoon-toilers and war-born to discuss politics together, even if the toilers rarely had anything valuable to add to the discussion.\n“||You maintain the Ks’ou are no longer a threat||,” Taghyr said. His crown was gangly, twisting in odd directions because it had not been well shaped. It was hard for Efyir to take him seriously, but others seemed to do so, which forced him to pay attention to this toiler with so few articulate words. “||Yet wasn’t it the final decision on Earth that keeps their species thriving to this day||?”\n“||The Great Alliance decided collectively on this course of action,||” General Shyridin said, though it sounded rather meek at this point. “||Thhiyatkhouw, I assure you, I elected against it. There would have been nothing greater than to rid ourselves, finally, of the enduring infamy of the Ks’ou ignominy, and I remind you that it has been my life’s work to undo the damage of this Human-based decision.||”\n“||What kind of Thiyatkhoor listens to the whims of Humans?||” Taghyr muttered. He had stepped back to say it away from the amplifier, so that the General would not hear his words but those in close proximity of the audience did, and it rippled in whispers throughout the rest of the crowd with a shockingly quick pace.\nThe General was of a dying era; older, but not considered wiser, his words were watered to soundbites of a mumbling ancient, relevant to only the forgotten, the near-buried, and the dead.\nThe session ended, they filed out, and each of what he once considered his own seemed to quicken or slow their pace aside Efyir. He stood outside the ceremony building wishing he had never gone, wishing against his own bloodline. Taghyr, in his grey-edged, light tan tunic, approached Efyir with several of his colleagues.\nIt was always Taghyr who seemed to speak; at least from what Efyir could remember. “||Ah, the Earth-born! Is that not true?||”\nEfyir grit his teeth. Taghyr and he were close in history; they both had head-naghryoja with only two shoots from their branches. Because of this, they followed many of the same classes, though Taghyr could not attend the warrior sessions once their shared classes ended. Their destinies were different, but because they were parallel, Efyir had no choice but to speak:\n“||It is no secret. My parents returned before I was of remembering age. And it was still a proper birth, in the woods.||”\n“||Then perhaps you are wiser than your father, the Human-lover,||” Taghyr sneered. His entourage, none of them warriors, offered unkind sounds of encouragement.\n“||His thesis is sound, even if it seems out of place,||” Efyir attempted.\n“||Your elder father has reached the end of his prime. Sure, he fought his wars, and well, it seems. But simply fighting a war does not give one permission to speak. Perhaps he should let the present Thhiyatkhoor frame the current world for him. After all, his moment is over.||”\nEfyir tried to leave; he truly did. But Taghyr was relentless, finding offense when the other turned his shoulder to him.\n“||You haven’t the courage to meet a like in battle. Your father is dust, while you, you do not even know what ripening is.||”\nEfyir stopped walking. His left arm extended as though automatic. A threat such as Taghyr’s could not go ignored if he could save any shred of his dignity among Thhiyatkhoor. He would not remember his arm blades meeting Taghyr’s face, but everyone present would tell of the satisfying shriek he gave when it happened.\n—\nJacque, pronounced Jack-ee with the Human tongue, was Kahti\u0026rsquo;s daughter. She looked like her mother but her hair, also very short, was completely black. She taught Efyir how to crouch in the hallway in such a way that he could hear the conversation on the OptiScreen without exposing himself. He would never have conceived of such a plan alone; he often defaulted to his own body, but was beginning to realize that stealth was a crucial advantage that Humans sometimes had, simply due to size and shape. As long as they were not in proximity to something that could sense as well as Thhiyatkhoor could, they would be fine.\nEfyir’s shell made him appear as human. It was an organo-synthetic material, a living fake as some called it, that he put on and would make him seem human. Like anything organic it needed watering and care, which the PODS provided. He’d chosen this one because it was the same strain as his father’s, the same model cut from his father’s cloth: dark hair, and skin the color of hethalu.\nThey could have found an off-market shell that would fold them into something slightly smaller, but Kahti was discerning and would notice them attempting to blend in with the wall. She said often ‘She had been around the block’ when it came to folding, though cubes and their relation to knowledge were still a mystery, as many human idioms, to Efyir.\nSo they sat there listening in, only able to hear Kahti\u0026rsquo;s replies but able to piece together what they could of her conversation with Efyir’s father, who was deliberately transmitting quietly.\n“He’s fine,” she was saying. “He’ll be attending school on Monday. I’ve arranged everything; they will only know his zilaa status, nothing else.”\nA pause. Then,\n“No. Not this year, either. Shyr, you need to come here yourself if you want. Maybe you can help me—damnit, of course I’ve tried. He would recognize your voice and might react differently. He’s your e—.”\nShe cut off, suddenly. Efyir was thinking about the fact that she called him ‘Shyr’. No one called him that, ever. That Humans reduced names to such a tiny bit of sound was still a mystery to him.\n“Yeah, I know it’s been awhile. But if it’s true that makes you and me the last of us. Doesn’t that matter to you?”\nSilence.\n“Well, he’s safe here. Do you want to talk to him? …Of course.” Kahti sighed rather loudly. “Right, I get it. No Human food. He’s under my care now, stop micro-managing.”\nShe ended the call abruptly, there was no wishing for success in battle as people often said goodbye to Efyir’s father—whether he was directly headed off to battle or not. The hallway creaked. Aunt Kahti—Efyir was instructed to call her that, because Aunt evoked Auntie—headed away from their position; to this he breathed a sigh of relief. She was grumbling under her breath, “If I want to give him fucking Human food, I will give him fucking Human food.”\nWhen he was sure she had gone to her room, he spoke, “Your mother is very bold. I have never seen anyone speak so directly to my father that way.”\n“Yeah,” Jacque said. She was a dark Human, not as dark as Kahti, but it struck Efyir how many shades Human skin could be. Thhiyatkhoor shades did not vary as widely. “You should see the way she talks to my dad.” As if to change the subject she hurried to add, “You shoulda burst in and demanded to speak to him.”\n“No,” Efyir said. “I have nothing to say to him.” The ship had only dropped him off a few days ago, and he still smarted from the reality of being here, stuck, with no way of escaping unless his father granted it.\nJacque regarded him haughtily, crossing her arms. He could tell she was annoyed—she taught him much about how Humans conveyed emotions. But then she seemed to relax. Humans go through many emotions in a very fast amount of time; it was hard to keep up, sometimes. “You seemed a more dangerous prob2 when we were kids, bro.”\nHe could tell she was relieved, and he was slightly, too, that he was here. When they were younger, they saw each other perhaps once an Earth year. But that practice stopped, suddenly, when Efyir’s father decided not to return some time ago. While Efyir was not fond of Earth, and often complained of its bizarre practices, he liked Jacque, who had always understood him, beyond his own blood sister.\n“I suppose there are worse reasons to be grounded here.” He shifted uncomfortably. His Human shell, the skin-like organic substance, was not the best thing he’d get to wear in his lifetime. In the house, he rarely wore it except when he was near Jacque and participated in her trickery, as she’d called it.\n“Ready for school tomorrow, Silverbutt?”\nHe did not, however, miss this nickname at all. “Don’t call me that. And yes, I am prepared for the Human version of education.”\nHe did not enroll in any technology courses. Even though Humans knew of and had access to some Thhiyatkhoor technologies, their understanding of them was diminished. Mostly he was to take courses in history, on his father’s demand: “Learn about your past, so that you may understand your present.”\nEfyir chose to take Anthropology of Carbon-Based Mammalian Lifeforms; he’d taken it on Routhhe, but the human version fascinated him because Humans continued to be attached to their own version of taxonomy. Though he burned with questions, his father’s adage forced him to be overwhelmingly quiet: “Speak to no one else but those who resonate with your own.”\nHis father often did not choose to be invisible. Years away from his home planet, from his people, had compelled him to be drawn towards visibility, and therefore to connection, with his people. Efyir’s host-Human on Earth, Aunt Kahti, on the other hand, seemed excessively the contrary to his father. She had withdrawn from Humans, had rebuilt her home in a swath of silence, underscored by nettles, vines, and weeds.\nBoth of them, heroes of Earth’s first alien colonial conquest vanquished by their past.\nIn a class arranged not much unlike Thhiyatkhoor lecture halls, he surveyed the room while his mind briefly drifted. He could count 3, maybe 4 zilaa like him. He was sure about the girl seated on the far left.\nHe’d met her in the woods once before, but decided not to pursue her attempted attack further. She wouldn’t recognize him now that he was in his shell, and he reminded himself as to how his host-aunt and host-sister constantly told him to “ease up”, that he need not invoke the disciplinary stance or military measures of his upbringing.\nThis zilaa girl seemed by her discourse to both critique and favor humans, and she’d said a few disturbingly even things about the greatest Thhiyatkhoor enemy, the Ks’ou. At this time, many aliens on Earth—except the Ks\u0026rsquo;ou, of course, sanctioned from shell technology and banned from Earth—could choose to take on a shell in place of their own biology and skin, to blend in more with Humans, as they preferred it.\nFor all their media and stories and imagination, when aliens actually came to Earth Humans proved themselves to be pretty uncomfortable about the whole ordeal, anticipating aliens without fully preparing for their difference. So they invented—Efyir had to admit, cleverly—the shell technology that would protect them from too much difference. The shells were like a human-appearing chamber, within which any alien (even if they were slightly larger than a human) were locked. It wasn’t hard to tell who was not-Human, as they all bore the same insignia, the Z imprinted on their neck. Still, it was difficult to tell who was specifically what. All zilaa could find a POD and eat or regenerate in private as their biology deemed fit, so Efyir could pretend to be any Earth-approved species he wanted to.\nWhen Efyir met her, he appreciated her balance, because she chose to straddle the invisible between, the invisible that was calculated; specific. Her shade of skin shell was as dark as slate as many Thhiyatkhoor, dark like Kahti and Jacque, and her hair, black with small, tight, twisted spirals, was pulled into two spheres on each side of her head with a cascade descending over her neck and back.\nShe often wore earrings in the shapes of leaves, and always a scarf.\nShe was scribbling in a book in front of her while the teacher spoke as though distracted, yet, remarkably, each time the teacher asked a question she leapt to answer. Efyir was fascinated but hopelessly lost; his Thhiyatkhoor education lent itself to preparing for the research facility or the battleground, so in the center of the course he turned to her.\n“Hello.”\nShe didn’t notice his words, so he waited to speak again. When she spoke up in class, he rose and responded with what he hoped would inspire a reaction: “Are you a Ks’ou sympathizer?”\nThis only seemed to anger her; though she noticed the Z-shaped pin grafted to the collar of the skin of his shell, she ignored him for the rest of class.\nHer manner of speaking, in addition to the way she’d fought in the woods, marked her as warrior-class. Indeed, she sparred as evenly with her words as she had with her arms.\n“I find you decently intolerable,” she would tell him later. This was perhaps progress. He would remember long cords of hair covering her face: bronze, round, discerning. “My name is Aurana.”\n[Next Chapter](\u0026laquo;ref \u0026ldquo;chapter-3.md\u0026rdquo; \u0026raquo;)\n   See Baldwin, J. “White Man’s Guilt.” Ebony Magazine, 1965. and Peck, R., Baldwin, J., Grellety, R., Aigui, A., Jackson, S.

You have wondered how long it will take to travel there. You have questioned why alien species who might live there have not reached out to you; made contact.\nI assure you, we know who you are. But you were not interesting to the rest of the universe. Not until we arrived on your planet to judge your corporeal potential.\nMy Ks’ou name and tree were never important to me. I was known as Commander, and I would become Ke’Ad, the highest rankings for a Ks’ou. My tactics were precise and effective. My praxis, bent towards the Ks’ou Nation. No one could question my dedication, and that is why I survived as long as I did. If you must know, I was born Kelisfton, Salix Adrath Kinë, kyôsta-fs2.\nYet as I said, that is not important.\nI was one of the last born on the homeworld before births were relegated to ships in preparation for world conquests. This offered me a compromised and composed position that was unique: the homeworld was mine, though it was not quite home for Ks’ou. I remembered it. And because I did, I later imagined what life might have been had we been able to establish a true culture, as Humans, Thhiyatkhoor, and so many others did.\nBut this was not to be our case.\nInstead, we were shuffled off into a war we had only begun to understand, started by others that we barely knew who came before us, and were sent to die for a cause that was not fully clear to us. All this was rather disorganized, I\u0026rsquo;ll admit.\n“War is the great equalizer,” was a phrase I would learn from a species I had not yet fully met. If I had heard the phrase at the time, I would not have understood. Equalizer of what? Ks\u0026rsquo;ou are deaf to outer-water creatures, though we easily hear one another. We are considered blind, but have our own way of seeing.\nKs\u0026rsquo;ou are brilliant.\nAmong ourselves, we were already equal, the only difference were those with ambition, as was I, and those without. We all had the same colonizing instinct.\nColonization was a great equalizer; Settling, a greater one. While some species wasted time colonizing one another to take ownership of resources, materials, land, and the like, Ks’ou had the greatest form of colonization of all. We were empowered with the ability to crawl into other creatures, extend ourselves into their furthest corners, and take over their bodies. We could harness their language, and, if skilled enough, colonize that creature mentally.\nOurs was a complete and holistic colonization.\nThen, war. Against other creatures, war was necessary to make us even. To put us on the plane so that other species would contend with us. We were born weak in body but mighty in spirit and intellect. We knew how to climb the ladder of master species, learning how to be adept through them, and subduing them when necessary. Our efforts would be in the name of making us present to the universe.\nLet our being be known.\n“Move in closer,” I ordered the lowly soldier manning the ship. This new planet, one I had recently discovered via the Thhiyatkhoor—our wretched enemy—was a risk, as it was likely that there would be Thhiyatkhoor on this planet as well, but one does not become Ke’Ad Designated anything by restraining from risks.\nI’d settled the body of a Besh, a large, four-torsoed creature with broad shoulders, a jaw that clenched, and skin like interwoven shards of glass. The formidable giant was as easy to control as it was to ignore. Its pleadings for me to release it had long since been set aside to simple whimpers and minute speculations about its future. They were simple, unsophistocated creatures, and it was unfortunate that so many had been slaughtered in war, as they made wonderful, powerful warriors.\nNot as good as the Olyat-Koi, however. The Besh bodies were strong, but minds weak. The Olyat-Koi excelled where the Besh—and humans—failed. For the Olyat-Koi, their flesh and spirit both intertwined in a dizzying display of ontological excellence, full of vast knowledge, and skilled in movement and grace.
